# llama2_test

Testing out Llama2 by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with movie dialogue (initially)

Will use this repository as a way to test different methods of fine-tuning Llama2 (https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama). Using this marvel text corpora, the goal is to change the writing style, since it may require billions of tokens to make an extreme change, based on assumptions made from the Llama2 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf).

It is a work in progress.
