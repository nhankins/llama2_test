# llama2_test

Testing out Llama2 by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with jeopardy questions and answers.

Will use this repository as a way to test different methods of fine-tuning Llama2 (https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama). Using this jeopardy Q&A corpus, the goal is to change the writing style, since it may require billions of tokens to make an extreme change, based on assumptions made from the Llama2 paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.09288.pdf).

Potential use cases can be to help train for applying to the game show, Jeopardy!


It is a work in progress.
